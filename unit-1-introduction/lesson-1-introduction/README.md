# Introduction

Welcome to **learn.rmotr.com**. This is a **FREE** and open platform used by [rmotr.com](https://rmotr.com) to conduct our classes.

> Please feel free to suggest things we could include in this guide. This guide is backed in a public and open source [Github repo](https://github.com/rmotr-curriculum/meta-how-to-use-learn) and everyone can contribute to it.

This platform is designed to be extremely simple to use, and it's structured in the following way:

## Courses

What you're currently browsing is, in learn's lingo, a **course**. A course will be divided in many **units** and each unit will contain many **lessons**. Other examples of courses include the material used for our [Advanced Python Programming Online Course](https://rmotr.com/advanced-python-programming) that you can see [here](http://learn.rmotr.com/python/advanced-python-programming-class-material/introduction/introduction), a mini-course about [How to work with Unicode in Python](http://learn.rmotr.com/python/understanding-unicode-in-python/strings-and-unicode/introduction) or our [Flask Tutorial Step by Step](http://learn.rmotr.com/python/flask-tutorial-step-by-step/first-steps/course-introduction).

## Units

Units allow us to separate our course in big "chunks" of information. It's a way to organize the many (usually +20) lessons that each course has, in a more human-friendly way.

For example, this course has just 1 unit "Introduction" as we didn't consider it necessary to break it down into more units. But our [Flask Tutorial](http://learn.rmotr.com/python/flask-tutorial-step-by-step/first-steps/course-introduction) has 5 units to structure the content in a proper way:

Finally, we say that a Unit is just a group of many **lessons**:

## Lessons

Lessons are the fundamental unit of information in [learn.rmotr.com](http://learn.rmotr.com). What you're currently reading is a lesson. Lessons let us structure different type of content, through the usage of different "reading lessons".

>You can see the source code of this lesson [here](#).

## Lesson types

Learn has content for many different types of "courses". That's why we need to have different types of lessons to support a great experience. Each different lesson type will have a different icon on the left menu.

#### Reading Lesson

This is the most basic type of lesson. It's just a simple lesson that contains text (and optionally) a youtube video. What you're currently reading is a _"Reading Lesson"_.

This is the icon of a reading lesson:

#### Assignment Lesson

A coding exercise to submit through learn. Learn more in the following section.

#### External Assignment Lesson

A coding exercise that must be sent through Github. More on it later

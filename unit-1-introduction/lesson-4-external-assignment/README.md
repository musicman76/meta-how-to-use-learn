# External Assignment Lesson

An external assignment lesson is also a lesson that contains a practical coding exercise, but instead of do it in learn, you will have to submit a pull request. For example, let's see how to solve the [First Exercise](http://learn.rmotr.com/python/flask-tutorial-step-by-step/first-steps/first-exercise) from our [Flask Tutorial Step by Step](http://learn.rmotr.com/python/flask-tutorial-step-by-step/first-steps/course-introduction):

## Step 1 - Fork the Repo

Click on the Fork Repo button:

You'll be redirected to the Github page of the assignment. Hit the "Fork" button on Github:

This will create a "copy" of that repository in your own Github Profile (please note my name `santiagobasulto`, it's my own personal copy):

Make the changes that you think are necessary to complete the assignment:

Commit your changes:

Then click on the "New Pull Request" button:

And Create your Pull Request (PR):

You'll see how we run the tests on the background:

And finally, if they pass or not (they failed in this case). You can check what went wrong with the "Details" link:

## Meantime... in Learn

Learn will keep the state of your current assignment. For example, in this case it knows I've submitted my PR but the tests are failing:

## Green

Once you solve your assignment and send/update the PR with the correct code, you'll see the tests passing on Github:

and the status on learn updated:

You can move now to the next lesson!
